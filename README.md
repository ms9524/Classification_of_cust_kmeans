Classification of customers using K Means clustering

## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial task for businesses aiming to tailor their products and services to specific customer needs. K Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for customer segmentation. It groups customers into distinct clusters based on similarities in their features.

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant customer data such as demographics, purchasing behavior, and preferences.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
3. **K Means Clustering**: Apply the K Means algorithm to cluster customers based on their features. Choose the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the elbow method.
4. **Interpretation**: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to understand customer segments and their unique attributes.
5. **Marketing Strategies**: Develop targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.
